N-Body Project

As part of a school project with a collegue we did a 1 week work on the N-body problem at the Strasbourg astronomical observatory with Dominique Aubert as supervisor.

In this project we study the basics of n-body simulation : Different integration schemes, conservation of energy, ...

With some pratical examples : Retrograte movement of Mars, Solar system, stability of Lagrange points

You will find in this repository a part of the work we did in Python with Jupiter-notebook (quite a raw code ^^)

Here are some result :

Solar System :
